This repository contains coursework from Computer Programming 1, where we learned the fundamentals of Java programming. Throughout the class, we practiced coding through lab exercises and reinforced our skills with three major homework assignments. Topics covered include Java syntax, variables, control flow, methods, object-oriented programming, and basic data structures. This repository serves as a collection of our work, showcasing the progress made in understanding and applying core Java concepts.
